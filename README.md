I've been fooling with claude-code and qwen3-coder-next. Mostly trying to get coding agents to do stuff I find tedious or annoying, like translating an algorithm from Python to R, adding API/FFI calls, or implementing simple algorithms from a paper. Adding separate directories for Claude and qwen3-coder-next. Trying to include the prompts I used to generate the code. Not recording the "OK rewrite this in this way" arguments with the thing that inevitably happen. Just giving a general idea of what kind of tasks can be done with these tools.


Probably most people who have used these tools will find these experiments uninteresting, but for numeric stuff it may be of interest. A few of the packages are also useful.

I've avoided the exercise for some years as the chatbots mostly seemed unable to accomplish relatively simple tasks like this, though recent exercises with qwen showed considerable improvement and tempted me to give them both a try.

The qwen stuff and the j package is mostly untested, though they seem to do the right things.
