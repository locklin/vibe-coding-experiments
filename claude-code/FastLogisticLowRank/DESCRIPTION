Title: Fast Binary Logistic Regression via Low-Rank Approximation
Version: 0.2.0
Authors@R: person("FastLogisticLowRank", "Authors", email = "maintainer@example.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Implements a fast binary logistic regression classifier using low-rank
    matrix approximation via SVD. The algorithm reduces computational cost by
    projecting the design matrix into a lower-dimensional space determined by an
    energy-based rank selection criterion. Supports L2 and adaptive Lp
    regularization. Based on the methodology described in the FBLR (Fast Binary
    Logistic Regression) framework.
