\title{Bernoulli Naive Bayes with EM Algorithm}
\description{
This package implements a Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier with Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm
for semi-supervised learning. It can handle both labeled and unlabeled documents.
}
\details{
The model represents documents by presence/absence of word stems (Bernoulli distribution).
For unlabeled documents, the EM algorithm iteratively estimates class probabilities and updates
model parameters to improve classification accuracy.
